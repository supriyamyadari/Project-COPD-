# Project-COPD
This is a Capstone project done in an internship program.
The main  aim of this project is to compare gene expression within small airway epithelial cells between normal non-smokers and smokers diagnosed with Early-COPD,as these small airways are the site of initial pathological alterations.By understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying COPD development and progression, particularly in response to cigarette smoke exposure, can provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions.

The contents of individual files has been explained below -

1 R Script DE_Analysis,Visualizations - This file contains all the R commands used for  downloading dataset,data cleaning, preprocessing ,data exploaration ,data visualization  and  performing differential expression analysis. 

2 Results of visualizations - This folder has the plots generated through data exploration and data visualization.

3 Results - Network & Functional analysis - Followed by differential expression analysis, functional annotation and pathway analysis has been done. A subset of genes associated with the early COPD pathway were selected to determine their potential as drug targets.Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) is used to identify potentially druggable genes.Network analysis has been done using STRING Database.This folder has results of fuctional analysis and pathway analysis.

#Tools and Softwares used in this project
RStudio(R-4.3.3), Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) database, DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery), DGIdb(Drug Gene Interaction Database), STRING Database.
